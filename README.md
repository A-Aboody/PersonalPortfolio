Portfolio

Hey! Welcome to my personal portfolio project. This is basically my playground where I get to experiment and showcase some of the things I've been learning. I'm posting it to GitHub because it's a great way for me to track my progress, improve along the way, and have something to look back on as I get better.

In this project, Iâ€™ve learned:
- a lot about CSS layouts
- responsive design
- how to integrate GitHub into my workflow. 

Every little piece of it is a stepping stone towards leveling up my web development skills. Feel free to check it out and see how it evolves!
